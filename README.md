🧰 Dev Toolbox – JSON Formatter
A simple full-stack web application to format raw JSON and view formatting history.

🚀 How to Run the App
🖥️ Backend (Expressjs – server/)

Run the application:
npm run dev

Backend will run on: http://localhost:8080

🌐 Frontend (React – client/)
Open another terminal in the client/ directory.

Install dependencies:
npm install

Run the frontend:
npm start
App will run on: http://localhost:3000

🔧 Features
Format raw JSON into readable structure

✅ View history of formatted JSON entries

✅ Dark mode toggle for better accessibility

✅ Copy to clipboard functionality

⏳ What I'd Improve With More Time
🔐 User Authentication: So users can save and manage their own JSON history

📦 Database Pagination: Limit and paginate history entries

💾 Export/Download JSON: Allow users to export formatted output

🌍 Deployment: Move backend to production using services like Render, Railway, or EC2
